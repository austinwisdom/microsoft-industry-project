# microsoft-industry-project 24hr hackathon challenge

Microsoft issued our bootcamp cohort an 24hr hackathon industry challenge 
to tackle the issue of transparent data privacy management.

Our web application integrates into existing Microsoft platforms to empower 
a head of household to easily manage their personal data, 
and that of the members of their family. 

It's a easy to use dashboard with security alerts, action steps, 
and general knowledge regarding how and where their data is being used legally and illegally.
